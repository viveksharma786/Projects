###ANN Learnings ###

**Small Dataset:** If the dataset is small, random fluctuations can have a larger impact on the accuracy.

**Learning Rate Issues:** A learning rate that is too high can cause the model to overshoot minima, while a learning rate that is too low can cause the model to converge too slowly.

**Batch Size:=**Small batch sizes can introduce more noise in the training process, leading to fluctuations in accuracy.

**Model Complexity:** If the model is too simple or too complex, it might not learn effectively from the data.

**Data Augmentation and Regularization**: Insufficient data augmentation and regularization can lead to overfitting, causing the accuracy to fluctuate.

**Suggestions to Improve:**
**Ensure Proper Data Splitting:** Make sure you have a good split of training, validation, and test sets to ensure the model is learning effectively.

**Tune Learning Rate:** Use learning rate finders and schedulers to set an appropriate learning rate.

**Increase Batch Size:** Try increasing the batch size to reduce noise in gradient updates.

**Model Architecture:** Experiment with different model architectures to find one that is suitable for your problem.

**Regularization:** Add regularization techniques like dropout, weight decay, and data augmentation to reduce overfitting.

**Early Stopping:** Implement early stopping based on validation loss to prevent overfitting.
